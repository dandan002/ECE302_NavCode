# ECE302_NavCode
This repository contains our (Daniel Jung, Yiying Zhang) work for the navigation project in ECE 302. Given a lack of... USB drives? Shared computers? we opted to maintain our entire PSOC Creator project in GitHub to ensure version control and access on any Windows machine. This means most of the files WILL NOT run in a traditional IDE/editor (save for our C files); users are meant to clone/download the entire repo and open as a PSOC creator project using relevant software.
## Usage
1. Clone/Download the ENTIRE REPO onto a Windows machine.
2. Open/Install PSOC Creator 4.4 (some parts will break when using newer versions).
3. Open the PSOC Creator project file inside the folder.
4. PSOC Creator will run like normal and take care of the rest.
## Documentation
Is nonexistant. Figure it out. We left a good number of comments/explanations in main.c but we never figured out how to insert comments in a top design file. That said, we do go very in-depth in our navigation report if you ever manage to get your hands on that.
