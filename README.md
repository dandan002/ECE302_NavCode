# ECE302_NavCode
This repository contains our (Daniel Jung, Yiying Zhang) work for the navigation project in ECE 302. Given a lack of... USB drives? Shared computers? we opted to maintain our entire PSOC Creator project in GitHub to ensure version control and access on any Windows machine. This means most of the files WILL NOT run in a traditional IDE/editor (save for our C files); users are meant to clone/download the entire repo and open as a PSOC creator project using relevant software.
